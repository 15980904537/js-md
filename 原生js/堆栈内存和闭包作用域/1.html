    <h2>4. Experiments</h2>
    <h3>4.1 ImageNet Classification</h3>
    <div>
        We evaluate our method on the ImageNet 2012 classification dataset that consists of 1000 classes. The models are trained on the 1.28 million training images, and evaluated on the 50k validation images. We also obtain a final result on the 100k test images,
        reported by the test server. We evaluate both top1 and top5 error rates.
    </div>
    <div>
        Plain Networks. We first evaluate 18 layer and 34 layer plain nets. The 34 layer plain net is in Fig. 3 (middle). The 18-layer plain net is of a similar form. See Table 1 for detailed architectures.
    </div>
    <div>
        The results in Table 2 show that the deeper 34 layer plain net has higher validation error than the shallower 18 layer plain net. To reveal the reasons, in Fig. 4 (left) we compare their training/validation errors during the training procedure. We have
        observed the degradation problem the 34 layer plain net has higher training error throughout the whole training procedure, even though the solution space of the 18 layer plain network is a subspace of that of the 34 layer one.
    </div>

    <div>---------------</div>
    <div>
        We argue that this optimization difficulty is unlikely to be caused by vanishing gradients. These plain networks are trained with BN , which ensures forward propagated signals to have non-zero variances. We also verify that the backward propagated gradients
        exhibit healthy norms with BN. So neither forward nor backward signals vanish. In fact, the 34-layer plain net is still able to achieve competitive accuracy (Table 3), suggesting that the solver works to some extent. We conjecture that the deep
        plain nets may have exponentially low convergence rates, which impact the reducing of the training error3 . The reason for such optimization difficulties will be studied in the future.
    </div>
    <div>
        Residual Networks. Next we evaluate 18 layer and 34 layer residual nets (ResNets). The baseline architectures are the same as the above plain nets, expect that a shortcut connection is added to each pair of 3×3 filters as in Fig. 3 (right). In the first
        comparison (Table 2 and Fig. 4 right), we use identity mapping for all shortcuts and zero-padding for increasing dimensions (option A). So they have no extra parameter compared to the plain counterparts
    </div>
    <div>
        We have three major observations from Table 2 and Fig. 4. First, the situation is reversed with residual learning – the 34 layer ResNet is better than the 18 layer ResNet (by 2.8%). More importantly, the 34-layer ResNet exhibits considerably lower training
        error and is generalizable to the validation data. This indicates that the degradation problem is well addressed in this setting and we manage to obtain accuracy gains from increased depth.
    </div>
    <div>------</div>
    <div>
        Second, compared to its plain counterpart, the 34-layer ResNet reduces the top-1 error by 3.5% (Table 2), resulting from the successfully reduced training error (Fig. 4 right vs. left). This comparison verifies the effectiveness of residual learning on
        extremely deep systems.
    </div>
    <div>
        Last, we also note that the 18-layer plain/residual nets are comparably accurate (Table 2), but the 18-layer ResNet converges faster (Fig. 4 right vs. left). When the net is “not overly deep” (18 layers here), the current SGD solver is still able to find
        good solutions to the plain net. In this case, the ResNet eases the optimization by providing faster convergence at the early stage.
    </div>
    <div>
        Identity vs. Projection Shortcuts. We have shown thatparameter-free, identity shortcuts help with training. Next we investigate projection shortcuts (Eqn.(2)). In Table 3 we compare three options: (A) zero-padding shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions,
        and all shortcuts are parameterfree (the same as Table 2 and Fig. 4 right); (B) projection shortcuts are used for increasing dimensions, and other shortcuts are identity; and (C) all shortcuts are projections.
    </div>
    <div>
        Table 3 shows that all three options are considerably better than the plain counterpart. B is slightly better than A. We argue that this is because the zero-padded dimensions in A indeed have no residual learning. C is marginally better than B, and we
        attribute this to the extra parameters introduced by many (thirteen) projection shortcuts. But the small differences among A/B/C indicate that projection shortcuts are not essential for addressing the degradation problem. So we do not use option
        C in the rest of this paper, to reduce memory/time complexity and model sizes. Identity shortcuts are particularly important for not increasing the complexity of the bottleneck architectures that are introduced below.
    </div>

        Table 5. Error rates (%) of ensembles. The top-5 error is on the test set of ImageNet and reported by the test server.
    </div>
    <div>---------------------</div>
    <div>
        Deeper Bottleneck Architectures. Next we describe our deeper nets for ImageNet. Because of concerns on the training time that we can afford, we modify the building block as a bottleneck design4 . For each residual function F, we use a stack of 3 layers
        instead of 2 (Fig. 5). The three layers are 1×1, 3×3, and 1×1 convolutions, where the 1×1 layers are responsible for reducing and then increasing (restoring) dimensions, leaving the 3×3 layer a bottleneck with smaller input/output dimensions.
        Fig. 5 shows an example, where both designs have similar time complexity.
    </div>
    <div>
        The parameter-free identity shortcuts are particularly important for the bottleneck architectures. If the identity shortcut in Fig. 5 (right) is replaced with projection, one can show that the time complexity and model size are doubled, as the shortcut
        is connected to the two high-dimensional ends. So identity shortcuts lead to more efficient models for the bottleneck designs
    </div>
    <div>
        50-layer ResNet: We replace each 2-layer block in the 34-layer net with this 3-layer bottleneck block, resulting in a 50-layer ResNet (Table 1). We use option B for increasing dimensions. This model has 3.8 billion FLOPs.
    </div>
    <div>
        101-layer and 152-layer ResNets: We construct 101- layer and 152-layer ResNets by using more 3-layer blocks (Table 1). Remarkably, although the depth is significantly increased, the 152-layer ResNet (11.3 billion FLOPs) still has lower complexity than
        VGG-16/19 nets (15.3/19.6 billion FLOPs).
    </div>
    <div>
        The 50/101/152-layer ResNets are more accurate than the 34-layer ones by considerable margins (Table 3 and 4). We do not observe the degradation problem and thus enjoy significant accuracy gains from considerably increased depth. The benefits of depth
        are witnessed for all evaluation metrics (Table 3 and 4).
    </div>
    <div>
        Comparisons with State-of-the-art Methods. In Table 4 we compare with the previous best single-model results. Our baseline 34-layer ResNets have achieved very competitive accuracy. Our 152-layer ResNet has a single-model top-5 validation error of 4.49%.
        This single-model result outperforms all previous ensemble results (Table 5). We combine six models of different depth to form an ensemble (only with two 152-layer ones at the time of submitting). This leads to 3.57% top-5 error on the test set
        (Table 5). This entry won the 1st place in ILSVRC 2015.
    </div>
    <h2>4.2 CIFAR-10 and Analysis</h2>
    <div>
        We conducted more studies on the CIFAR-10 dataset , which consists of 50k training images and 10k testing images in 10 classes. We present experiments trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. Our focus is on the behaviors of extremely
        deep networks, but not on pushing the state-of-the-art results, so we intentionally use simple architectures as follows.
    </div>
    <div>
        The plain/residual architectures follow the form in Fig. 3 (middle/right). The network inputs are 32×32 images, with the per-pixel mean subtracted. The first layer is 3×3 convolutions. Then we use a stack of 6n layers with 3×3 convolutions on the feature
        maps of sizes {32, 16, 8} respectively, with 2n layers for each feature map size. The numbers of filters are {16, 32, 64} respectively. The subsampling is performed by convolutions with a stride of 2. The network ends with a global average pooling,
        a 10-way fully-connected layer, and softmax. There are totally 6n+2 stacked weighted layers. The following table summarizes the architecture:
    </div>
    <div>
        When shortcut connections are used, they are connected to the pairs of 3×3 layers (totally 3n shortcuts). On this dataset we use identity shortcuts in all cases (i.e., option A),so our residual models have exactly the same depth, width, and number of
        parameters as the plain counterparts.
    </div>
    <div>
        We use a weight decay of 0.0001 and momentum of 0.9, and adopt the weight initialization in and BN but with no dropout. These models are trained with a minibatch size of 128 on two GPUs. We start with a learning rate of 0.1, divide it by 10 at 32k and
        48k iterations, and terminate training at 64k iterations, which is determined on a 45k/5k train/val split. We follow the simple data augmentation in for training: 4 pixels are padded on each side, and a 32×32 crop is randomly sampled from the
        padded image or its horizontal flip. For testing, we only evaluate the single view of the original 32×32 image.
    </div>
    <div>
        We compare n = {3, 5, 7, 9}, leading to 20, 32, 44, and 56-layer networks. Fig. 6 (left) shows the behaviors of the plain nets. The deep plain nets suffer from increased depth, and exhibit higher training error when going deeper. This phenomenon is similar
        to that on ImageNet (Fig. 4, left) and on MNIST , suggesting that such an optimization difficulty is a fundamental problem.
    </div>
    <div>
        Fig. 6 (middle) shows the behaviors of ResNets. Also similar to the ImageNet cases (Fig. 4, right), our ResNets manage to overcome the optimization difficulty and demonstrate accuracy gains when the depth increases.
    </div>
    <div>
        We further explore n = 18 that leads to a 110-layer ResNet. In this case, we find that the initial learning rate of 0.1 is slightly too large to start converging5 . So we use 0.01 to warm up the training until the training error is below 80% (about 400
        iterations), and then go back to 0.1 and continue training. The rest of the learning schedule is as done previously. This 110-layer network converges well (Fig. 6, middle). It has fewer parameters than other deep and thin networks such as FitNet
        and Highway (Table 6), yet is among the state-of-the-art results (6.43%, Table 6).
    </div>

    <div>
        Analysis of Layer Responses. Fig. 7 shows the standard deviations (std) of the layer responses. The responses are the outputs of each 3×3 layer, after BN and before other nonlinearity (ReLU/addition). For ResNets, this analysis reveals the response strength
        of the residual functions. Fig. 7 shows that ResNets have generally smaller responses than their plain counterparts. These results support our basic motivation (Sec.3.1) that the residual functions might be generally closer to zero than the non-residual
        functions. We also notice that the deeper ResNet has smaller magnitudes of responses, as evidenced by the comparisons among ResNet-20, 56, and 110 in Fig. 7. When there are more layers, an individual layer of ResNets tends to modify the signal
        less.
    </div>
    <div>
        Exploring Over 1000 layers. We explore an aggressively deep model of over 1000 layers. We set n = 200 that leads to a 1202-layer network, which is trained as described above. Our method shows no optimization difficulty, and this 103 -layer network is
        able to achieve training error 《0.1% (Fig. 6, right). Its test error is still fairly good (7.93%, Table 6).
    </div>
    <div>
        But there are still open problems on such aggressively deep models. The testing result of this 1202-layer network is worse than that of our 110-layer network, although both have similar training error. We argue that this is because of overfitting. The
        1202-layer network may be unnecessarily large (19.4M) for this small dataset. Strong regularization such as maxout or dropout is applied to obtain the best results on this dataset. In this paper, we use no maxout/dropout and just simply impose
        regularization via deep and thin architectures by design, without distracting from the focus on the difficulties of optimization. But combining with stronger regularization may improve results, which we will study in the future.

    <h2>4.3 Object Detection on PASCAL and MS COCO</h2>
    <div>
        Our method has good generalization performance on other recognition tasks. Table 7 and 8 show the object detection baseline results on PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 and COCO . We adopt Faster R-CNN as the detection method. Here we are interested in the improvements
        of replacing VGG-16 with ResNet-101. The detection implementation (see appendix) of using both models is the same, so the gains can only be attributed to better networks. Most remarkably, on the challenging COCO dataset we obtain a 6.0% increase
        in COCO’s standard metric (mAP@[.5, .95]), which is a 28% relative improvement. This gain is solely due to the learned representations
    </div>
    <div>
        Based on deep residual nets, we won the 1st places in several tracks in ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions: ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation. The details are in the appendix.
    </div>

    <h2>A. Object Detection Baselines</h2>
    <div>
        In this section we introduce our detection method based on the baseline Faster R-CNN system. The models are initialized by the ImageNet classification models, and then fine-tuned on the object detection data. We have experimented with ResNet-50/101 at
        the time of the ILSVRC & COCO 2015 detection competitions
    </div>
    <div>
        Unlike VGG-16 used in , our ResNet has no hidden fc layers. We adopt the idea of “Networks on Conv feature maps” (NoC) to address this issue. We compute the full-image shared conv feature maps using those layers whose strides on the image are no greater
        than 16 pixels (i.e., conv1, conv2 x, conv3 x, and conv4 x, totally 91 conv layers in ResNet-101; Table 1). We consider these layers as analogous to the 13 conv layers in VGG-16, and by doing so, both ResNet and VGG-16 have conv feature maps of
        the same total stride (16 pixels). These layers are shared by a region proposal network (RPN, generating 300 proposals) and a Fast R-CNN detection network . RoI pooling is performed before conv5 1. On this RoI-pooled feature, all layers of conv5
        x and up are adopted for each region, playing the roles of VGG-16’s fc layers. The final classification layer is replaced by two sibling layers (classification and box regression ).
    </div>
    <div>
        For the usage of BN layers, after pre-training, we compute the BN statistics (means and variances) for each layer on the ImageNet training set. Then the BN layers are fixed during fine-tuning for object detection. As such, the BN layers become linear
        activations with constant offsets and scales, and BN statistics are not updated by fine-tuning. We fix the BN layers mainly for reducing memory consumption in Faster R-CNN training.
    </div>
    <h2>PASCAL VOC</h2>
    <div>
        Following , for the PASCAL VOC 2007 test set, we use the 5k trainval images in VOC 2007 and 16k trainval images in VOC 2012 for training (“07+12”). For the PASCAL VOC 2012 test set, we use the 10k trainval+test images in VOC 2007 and 16k trainval images
        in VOC 2012 for training (“07++12”). The hyper-parameters for training Faster R-CNN are the same as in . Table 7 shows the results. ResNet-101 improves the mAP by >3% over VGG-16. This gain is solely because of the improved features learned by
        ResNet.
    </div>
    <h2>MS COCO</h2>
    <div>
        The MS COCO dataset involves 80 object categories. We evaluate the PASCAL VOC metric (mAP @ IoU = 0.5) and the standard COCO metric (mAP @ IoU = .5:.05:.95). We use the 80k images on the train set for training and the 40k images on the val set for evaluation.
        Our detection system for COCO is similar to that for PASCAL VOC. We train the COCO models with an 8-GPU implementation, and thus the RPN step has a mini-batch size of
    </div>
    <div>
        8 images (i.e., 1 per GPU) and the Fast R-CNN step has a mini-batch size of 16 images. The RPN step and Fast RCNN step are both trained for 240k iterations with a learning rate of 0.001 and then for 80k iterations with 0.0001.
    </div>
    <div>
        Table 8 shows the results on the MS COCO validation set. ResNet-101 has a 6% increase of mAP@[.5, .95] over VGG-16, which is a 28% relative improvement, solely contributed by the features learned by the better network. Remarkably, the mAP@[.5, .95]’s
        absolute increase (6.0%) is nearly as big as mAP@.5’s (6.9%). This suggests that a deeper network can improve both recognition and localization.
    </div>
    <h2>B. Object Detection Improvements</h2>
    <div>
        For completeness, we report the improvements made for the competitions. These improvements are based on deep features and thus should benefit from residual learning.
    </div>
    <div>
        Box refinement. Our box refinement partially follows the iterative localization in . In Faster R-CNN, the final output is a regressed box that is different from its proposal box. So for inference, we pool a new feature from the regressed box and obtain
        a new classification score and a new regressed box. We combine these 300 new predictions with the original 300 predictions. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is applied on the union set of predicted boxes using an IoU threshold of 0.3 , followed by
        box voting . Box refinement improves mAP by about 2 points (Table 9).
    </div>
    <div>
        Global context. We combine global context in the Fast R-CNN step. Given the full-image conv feature map, we pool a feature by global Spatial Pyramid Pooling (with a “single-level” pyramid) which can be implemented as “RoI” pooling using the entire image’s
        bounding box as the RoI. This pooled feature is fed into the post-RoI layers to obtain a global context feature. This global feature is concatenated with the original per-region feature, followed by the sibling classification and box regression
        layers. This new structure is trained end-to-end. Global context improves mAP@.5 by about 1 point (Table 9).
    </div>
    <div>
        Multi-scale testing. In the above, all results are obtained by single-scale training/testing as in , where the image’s shorter side is s = 600 pixels. Multi-scale training/testing has been developed in by selecting a scale from a feature pyramid, and
        in by using maxout layers. In our current implementation, we have performed multi-scale testing following ; we have not performed multi-scale training because of limited time. In addition, we have performed multi-scale testing only for the Fast
        R-CNN step (but not yet for the RPN step). With a trained model, we compute conv feature maps on an image pyramid, where the image’s shorter sides are s ∈ {200, 400, 600, 800, 1000}.
    </div>
    <div>
        We select two adjacent scales from the pyramid following . RoI pooling and subsequent layers are performed on the feature maps of these two scales , which are merged by maxout as in . Multi-scale testing improves the mAP by over 2 points (Table 9).
    </div>
    <div>
        Using validation data. Next we use the 80k+40k trainval set for training and the 20k test-dev set for evaluation. The testdev set has no publicly available ground truth and the result is reported by the evaluation server. Under this setting, the results
        are an mAP@.5 of 55.7% and an mAP@[.5, .95] of 34.9% (Table 9). This is our single-model result.
    </div>
    <div>
        Ensemble. In Faster R-CNN, the system is designed to learn region proposals and also object classifiers, so an ensemble can be used to boost both tasks. We use an ensemble for proposing regions, and the union set of proposals are processed by an ensemble
        of per-region classifiers. Table 9 shows our result based on an ensemble of 3 networks. The mAP is 59.0% and 37.4% on the test-dev set. This result won the 1st place in the detection task in COCO 2015.

    <div>
        We revisit the PASCAL VOC dataset based on the above model. With the single model on the COCO dataset (55.7% mAP@.5 in Table 9), we fine-tune this model on the PASCAL VOC sets. The improvements of box refinement, context, and multi-scale testing are also
        adopted. By doing so we achieve 85.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007 (Table 10) and 83.8% on PASCAL VOC 2012 (Table 11) 6 . The result on PASCAL VOC 2012 is 10 points higher than the previous state-of-the-art result.
    </div>
    <div>
        The ImageNet Detection (DET) task involves 200 object categories. The accuracy is evaluated by mAP@.5. Our object detection algorithm for ImageNet DET is the same as that for MS COCO in Table 9. The networks are pretrained on the 1000-class ImageNet classification
        set, and are fine-tuned on the DET data. We split the validation set into two parts (val1/val2) following . We fine-tune the detection models using the DET training set and the val1 set. The val2 set is used for validation. We do not use other
        ILSVRC 2015 data. Our single model with ResNet-101 has 58.8% mAP and our ensemble of 3 models has 62.1% mAP on the DET test set (Table 12). This result won the 1st place in the ImageNet detection task in ILSVRC 2015, surpassing the second place
        by 8.5 points (absolute).
    </div>
    <h2>C. ImageNet Localization</h2>
    <div>
        The ImageNet Localization (LOC) task requires to classify and localize the objects. Following , we assume that the image-level classifiers are first adopted for predicting the class labels of an image, and the localization algorithm only accounts for
        predicting bounding boxes based on the predicted classes. We adopt the “per-class regression” (PCR) strategy , learning a bounding box regressor for each class. We pre-train the networks for ImageNet classification and then fine-tune them for
        localization. We train networks on the provided 1000-class ImageNet training set.
    </div>
    <div>
        Our localization algorithm is based on the RPN framework of with a few modifications. Unlike the way in that is category-agnostic, our RPN for localization is designed in a per-class form. This RPN ends with two sibling 1×1 convolutional layers for binary
        classification (cls) and box regression (reg), as in . The cls and reg layers are both in a per-class from, in contrast to . Specifically, the cls layer has a 1000-d output, and each dimension is binary logistic regression for predicting being
        or not being an object class; the reg layer has a 1000×4-d output consisting of box regressors for 1000 classes. As in , our bounding box regression is with reference to multiple translation-invariant “anchor” boxes at each position.
    </div>

        As in our ImageNet classification training (Sec. 3.4), we randomly sample 224×224 crops for data augmentation. We use a mini-batch size of 256 images for fine-tuning. To avoid negative samples being dominate, 8 anchors are randomly sampled for each image,
        where the sampled positive and negative anchors have a ratio of 1:1 . For testing, the network is applied on the image fully-convolutionally.

        Table 13 compares the localization results. Following , we first perform “oracle” testing using the ground truth class as the classification prediction. VGG’s paper reports a center-crop error of 33.1% (Table 13) using ground truth classes. Under the
        same setting, our RPN method using ResNet-101 net significantly reduces the center-crop error to 13.3%. This comparison demonstrates the excellent performance of our framework. With dense (fully convolutional) and multi-scale testing, our ResNet-101
        has an error of 11.7% using ground truth classes. Using ResNet-101 for predicting classes (4.6% top-5 classification error, Table 4), the top-5 localization error is 14.4%.

        The above results are only based on the proposal network (RPN) in Faster R-CNN . One may use the detection network (Fast R-CNN ) in Faster R-CNN to improve the results. But we notice that on this dataset, one image usually contains a single dominate object,
        and the proposal regions highly overlap with each other and thus have very similar RoI-pooled features. As a result, the image-centric training of Fast R-CNN generates samples of small variations, which may not be desired for stochastic training.
        Motivated by this, in our current experiment we use the original RCNN that is RoI-centric, in place of Fast R-CNN

        Our R-CNN implementation is as follows. We apply the per-class RPN trained as above on the training images to predict bounding boxes for the ground truth class. These predicted boxes play a role of class-dependent proposals. For each training image, the
        highest scored 200 proposals are extracted as training samples to train an R-CNN classifier. The image region is cropped from a proposal, warped to 224×224 pixels, and fed into the classification network as in R-CNN . The outputs of this network
        consist of two sibling fc layers for cls and reg, also in a per-class form. This R-CNN network is fine-tuned on the training set using a mini-batch size of 256 in the RoI-centric fashion. For testing, the RPN generates the highest scored 200 proposals
        for each predicted class, and the R-CNN network is used to update these proposals’ scores and box positions.

        This method reduces the top-5 localization error to 10.6% (Table 13). This is our single-model result on the validation set. Using an ensemble of networks for both classification and localization, we achieve a top-5 localization error of 9.0% on the test
        set. This number significantly outperforms the ILSVRC 14 results (Table 14), showing a 64% relative reduction of error. This result won the 1st place in the ImageNet localization task in ILSVRC 2015.
